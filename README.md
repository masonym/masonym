> junior dev.

hey, i'm mason leitch — a full-stack developer based in vancouver, bc. i write code, mostly with typescript, next.js, and AWS, and i am trying to make stuff that actual humans use! i'd love to expand my horizons in terms of tech stacks; i spent a while learning the "safe" stuff like react, but lately i've wanted to step outside of the box a little more.

## 👷‍♂️ what i'm building

### 🔧 [maplestory tools](https://masonym.dev/)
platform of tools for the MMORPG *MapleStory* used by 10k+ monthly players. built with next.js, typescript, and a custom ETL pipeline (c#/python) that parses thousands of in-game items from raw client files. always thinking about more things to add.

### 🛡️ [american defense alliance site](https://www.americandefensealliance.org)
event + content platform for a defense industry startup. replaced a stalled wix build with a performant next.js site that serves dynamic event pages, speaker rosters, admin tools, and CDN-optimized media delivery. built solo. still live.

### 💅 med spa booking + ecommerce platform (coming soon)
custom frontend + cart + booking system for a small business in the medical aesthetics space. integrates with square’s apis to bypass the default jank and deliver smooth scheduling and payments. app router, custom backend routes, tailored UI.

## 🧠 what i know

- **languages**: typescript / javascript, python, php  
- **frontend**: react, next.js, tailwind
- **backend**: node.js, django
- **infra**: aws (lambda, dynamodb, s3, cloudfront, api gateway), vercel, cloudflare
- **tools**: neovim (btw 🤓), git (hopefully a given)

## 💬 what i'm like

- big fan of doing it wrong until it’s right 
- still trying to figure everything out
- obsessed with performance (this seems to contradict the fact that im mostly building with React... we will fix this eventually)
- i love good documentation!!!!
